                        Your store sells t-shirts in twelve different sizes.  There are six sizes (small, medium, large, xl, xxl, and xxxl) and these
                        sizes vary by sex (male and female).  A sizing chart must be included on this page as shown in Figure 1.  The table in this
                        screenshot is bordered so that you can visualize it's structure.  Since this data is not an image, it is incorrect
                        to use an image for this purpose.  Also, do <em>not</em> include the borders in your HTML.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The t-shirts can also be made as allergy-sensitive (you use allergy-free dyes upon request), premium-cotton (100% cotton with a denser weave), 
                    domestically produced (some products are obtained overseas while the domestic products are made in the USA) and ultra-violet protection 
                    (the t-shirts are treated for UV protection).  Any combination (or none) of these extra features can be applied.  For example, an order
                    could include allergy-senstive domestically produced t-shirts or an order could include UV-protected, domestically produced, premium-cotton t-shirts.
