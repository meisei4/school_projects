    <h1>What is the meaning of Life?</h1>
    <p>
      Questions about the meaning of life have been expressed in a
      broad variety of ways, including the following:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Who are we?</li>
      <li>What is the meaning and significance of life?</li>
      <li>Why are we here?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      The meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious
      conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness,
      and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology,
      value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, the existence of one
      or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife.
      Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related
      empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and
      parameters concerning the <em class="sq">how</em> of life. Science also studies and can
      provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related
      conception of morality. An alternative, humanistic approach poses the
      question <q><em>What is the meaning of my life</em>?</q> The value of the question
      pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of
      ultimate reality, or a feeling of oneness, or even a feeling of
      sacredness.

          Theists believe God created the universe and that God had a
          purpose in doing so. Many theists, including the former atheist
          Antony Flew, have been persuaded that God created because of the
          scientific evidence for a low entropy Big Bang more than 13 billion
          years ago. Theists also hold the view that humans find their meaning
          and purpose for life in God's purpose in creating. Theists further
          hold that if there were no God to give life ultimate meaning, value
          and purpose, then life would be absurd.

          Nihilism suggests that life is without objective meaning.
          Fredrich Nietzsche characterized nihilism as emptying the world, and
          especially human existence, of meaning, purpose, comprehensible
          truth, and essential value; succinctly, nihilism is the process of
          "the devaluing of the highest values". Seeing the nihilist as a
          natural result of the idea that God is dead, and insisting it was
          something to overcome, his questioning of the nihilist's
          life-negating values returned meaning to the Earth.

          Postmodernist thought—broadly speaking—sees human nature as
          constructed by language, or by structures and institutions of human
          society. Unlike other forms of philosophy, postmodernism rarely
          seeks out a priori or innate meanings in human existence, but
          instead focuses on analyzing or critiquing given meanings in order
          to rationalize or reconstruct them. Anything resembling a "meaning
          of life", in postmodernist terms, can only be understood within a
          social and linguistic framework, and must be pursued as an escape
          from the power structures that are already embedded in all forms of
          speech and interaction.
