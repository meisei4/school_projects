				<h1>High School</h1>
				<blockquote cite = http://www.pu.if.ua/depart/Inmov/resource/file/samostijna_robota/Catcher_In_The_Rye_-_J_D_Salinger.pdf>One of the biggest reasons I left Elkton Hills was because I was surrounded by phonies. That's all. They were coming in the goddam window. For instance, they had this headmaster, Mr. Haas, that was the

				those that would do in the world; but that's just protective coloration. Like the church in the Middle Ages, which didn't give a
