            <h2>Retailers' Customers Cautioned As Cyber Attacks Continue</h2>

            Home Depot says some 56 million card holders were possibly compromised in a cyber attack. It
            says there's no evidence that debit PIN numbers were comprised or that the breach affected 
            online shoppers.

                The latest big retailer to suffer a cyber attack is Home Depot.
                The big-box home repair store says some 56 million cardholders were possibly
                compromised in a cyber attack. It's the latest in a string of data breaches.
                And as NPR's <span class="crossref">Sonari Glinton</span>, it is not likely to be the last.
            </p>

            <p>
                Home Depot's data breach was first reported at the beginning of
                this month by <span class="crossref">Brian Krebs</span> on his blog.
                He's the go-to guy for this kind of
                stuff, so he's going to help me explain how the Home Depot hack went down.
                It starts the moment you swipe your credit or debit card to complete a purchase.
            </p>

            <p>
                There's this moment where the information gets transferred from the little terminal
                that you use to swipe your card - that is separate and apart from the cash
                register itself, which is essentially a Windows computer.

                We are asking why, despite all the diverse and creative work being produced in other media,
                Broadway still seems to be

                It has yet to reflect the dynamic stories in the nation, the arts, or the vibrant city it calls home.

                We'll ask why that matters, and what might change it.

            <h2>The Kaypro II: An Early Computer With A Writer's Heart</h2>

            Commentator Andrei Codrescu remembers the first word processor he had â€”
            the Kaypro II in the 1980s. Its inventor, Andrew Kay, died Aug. 28, at the age of 95.

                Somebody called it a portable, but it was really a luggable. It looked like
                it could take a direct hit from a bomb, inside a bunker. Its shiny metal body
                protruded and protected a tiny screen; it also protected me. I felt like a kid
                again, writing in my secret diary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Until the Kaypro, the hottest accessory of any self-respecting writer was the
                Selectric typewriter. The Kaypro was not an accessory; it let you write
                with light on glass, not ink on paper, which was mind-blowing. It felt both
                godlike and ephemeral. My goal at the time was <q>to do to things what light does to them,</q>
                a verse by the French poet Guillevic.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was incredibly hip. And it made writing something very different.
